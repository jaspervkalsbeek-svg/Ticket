## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the library. Also make sure you have enabled and configured the
[GD extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) if you want to generate images.

```bash
composer require amirezaeb/heroqr
```

### 2. Basic Usage

- **Generate a simple QR code in just a few lines of code:**

#### Example :

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
use HeroQR\Core\QRCodeGenerator;

# Create a QRCodeGenerator instance
$qrCodeManager = new QRCodeGenerator();

$qrCode = $qrCodeManager
    # Set the data to be encoded in the QR code
    ->setData('https://test.org') 
    # Generate the QR code in PNG format (default)
    ->generate();

# Save the generated QR code to a file named 'qrcode.png'
$qrCode->saveTo('qrcode'); 
```

### 3. Advanced Customization

- **Fully customize the appearance and functionality of your QR code with automatic data validation:**

    - **Customization Options:** Modify various parameters such as size, color, logo, and more.
    - **Automatic Data Validation:** By using `DataType` (optional), the library automatically validates the type of data being encoded (e.g., URL, Email, Phone, Location, Wifi, Text).

#### Example :

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use HeroQR\Core\QRCodeGenerator;
use HeroQR\DataTypes\DataType;

# Create a QRCodeGenerator instance
$qrCodeManager = new QRCodeGenerator();

$qrCode = $qrCodeManager
    # Set data to be encoded and validate it as an Email
    ->setData('aabrahimi1718@gmail.com', DataType::Email)  
    # Set background and QR code colors
    ->setBackgroundColor('#ffffffFF')
    # Set the QR code's color
    ->setColor('#fc031c')
    # Set the size of the QR code (default size is 800)
    ->setSize(900)
    # Set the logo to be embedded at the center (default size is 80)
    ->setLogo('../assets/HeroExpert.png', 100 )
    # Set the margin around the QR code (default size is 10)
    ->setMargin(0)
    # Set character encoding for the QR code (default encoding is UTF-8)
    ->setEncoding('CP866')
    # Set the error correction level for the QR code (default is "High")
    ->setErrorCorrectionLevel('Medium')
    # Set the block size mode to "None" (default is "Margin")
    ->setBlockSizeMode('None')
    # Customize the label with text, alignment, color, and font size
    ->setLabel(
        # Label Text
        label: 'To Contact Me, Just Scan This QRCode',
        # Label align (default: center)
        textAlign: 'right',
        # Label text color (default: #000000)
        textColor: '#fc031c',
        # Label size (default: 50)
        fontSize: 35,
        # Label margin (default: 0, 10, 10, 10)
        margin: [15, 15, 15, 15] 
    )
    # Generate the QR code in WebP format
    ->generate('webp');

# Save the generated QR code to a file
$qrCode->saveTo('custom-qrcode');
``` 

With these options, you can create visually appealing QR codes that align with your design needs.

### 4. Customizing Shapes, Markers, and Cursors (PNG Only)

HeroQR allows you to fully customize the markers, cursors, and shapes of your QR codes. This feature is exclusive to PNG output. To use this feature, specify the output format with `generate('png', [ ... ])` and include the desired parameters for shape, marker, and cursor types.

#### Available Options:

- **Shapes**: `S1` - `S2` - `S3` - `S4`
- **Markers**: `M1` - `M2` - `M3` - `M4` - `M5` - `M6`
- **Cursors**: `C1` - `C2` - `C3` - `C4` - `C5` - `C6`

These options allow you to modify the appearance of the QR code, making it more personalized or stylish. Shapes modify the corners, markers change the patterns on the dots, and cursors adjust the positioning pointers.

#### Example :

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use HeroQR\Core\QRCodeGenerator;

# Create a QRCodeGenerator instance
$qrCodeManager = new QRCodeGenerator();

$qrCode = $qrCodeManager
    ->setData('https://example.com')
    ->setSize(800)
    ->setBackgroundColor('#ffffffFF')
    ->setColor('#000000')
    # Customize the Shape (Circle), Marker (Circle), and Cursor (Circle)
    ->generate('png',[
            'Shape' => 'S2',
            'Marker' => 'M2',
            'Cursor' => 'C2'
        ]);

# Save the generated QR code with customizations
$qrCode->saveTo('custom-qr');
```

**Example QR Code Outputs with Different Combinations :** Below are some examples of QR codes generated using various combinations of shapes, markers, and cursors:

- **Experiment with Different Combinations:** In this section, you can experiment with various combinations of shapes, markers, and cursors to create unique QR codes that best suit your needs. Each combination will impact the appearance of the QR code, from the corners and points to the positioning of the markers. Simply adjust the parameters to customize your QR codes.

### 5. Advanced Output Options

HeroQR provides advanced output capabilities, offering flexibility and compatibility for various use cases, from web embedding to raw data manipulation:

- **String Representation :** Retrieve the QR code as a raw string, which can be useful for direct processing or custom transformations.

- **Matrix Output :** Represent the QR code as a matrix (2D array) of bits, where each block of the matrix corresponds to a specific piece of the encoded data. You can retrieve the matrix in two forms:
  - As a `Matrix` object.
  - As a 2D array, which makes it easier to manipulate or display directly in some applications.
  
- **Base64 Encoding :** Generate the QR code as a Base64-encoded string, which is ideal for embedding directly in HTML, emails, or other media.

- **Saving to Different Formats :** You can save the QR code in a variety of formats such as PNG, SVG, GIF, WebP, EPS, PDF, Binary, and more. The format is automatically determined based on the desired output type.

#### Example

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use HeroQR\Core\QRCodeGenerator;

# Create a QRCodeGenerator instance
$qrCodeManager = new QRCodeGenerator();

$qrCode = $qrCodeManager
    # Set the data to be encoded in the QR code
    ->setData('https://test.org') 
    # Generate the QR code in PNG format (default)
    ->generate();

# Get the QR code as a string representation
$string = $qrCode->getString();

# Get the QR code as a matrix object
$matrix = $qrCode->getMatrix();

# Get the matrix as a 2D array
$matrixArray = $qrCode->getMatrixAsArray();

# Get the QR code as Base64 encoding for embedding in HTML
$dataUri = $qrCode->getDataUri();

# Save the QR code to a file in the desired format (WebP, GIF, Binary, Esp, PNG, SVG, PDF)
$qrCode->saveTo('qr_code_output');

```
